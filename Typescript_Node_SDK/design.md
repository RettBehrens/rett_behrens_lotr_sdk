This SDK was built following the OpenAPI Specification. A YAML file describing the LOTR API was reverse engineered based on available API documentation and inspecting API response JSON using Swagger Inspector. Reusable components defining API security requirements, API server path, available API endpoints, and API responses allow not only for easy extensibility and maintainability but also API documentation and SDK generation. For example, if in the future the LOTR API were to add OAuth standard authorization grant type so users can authorize 3rd party apps to interact with the LOTR API on the user's behalf, adding this functionality to the SDKs would be a simple update to the YAML file adding the new security scheme.
